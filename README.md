## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running code interactively)
- Required Python libraries (install with pip as mentioned in the code)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-age-prediction.git

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd face-age-prediction

1. Install the required Python libraries::

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. **Download the face age dataset in a ZIP file format** and place it in a directory.

2. **Update the `zip_file_path` variable in the code** with the correct path to your ZIP file.

3. **Run the code** to extract the dataset and preprocess the images.

### Model Training

1. **Define and compile the CNN model in the code** according to your requirements.

2. **Run the code** to train the model using the preprocessed data.

### Model Evaluation

1. After training, **evaluate the model on the test set** and print evaluation results such as loss, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### Age Prediction

1. **Use the trained model to make age predictions for new images**. Provide the path to the image in the code, and it will predict the age.

## Customization

You can customize the code and model architecture according to your specific dataset and requirements. Here are some ways to customize the project:

1. **Model Architecture**: Adjust the CNN layers and their hyperparameters in the code to fine-tune the model's performance.

2. **Preprocessing**: Modify the preprocessing steps to suit the characteristics of your dataset. You can change image resizing, color transformations, or normalization techniques.

3. **Data Augmentation**: If needed, add data augmentation techniques using libraries like Keras ImageDataGenerator to improve model generalization.

4. **Batching and Shuffling**: Handle batching and shuffling according to your dataset's size and distribution. You can fine-tune batch sizes and shuffling strategies during model training.

Feel free to experiment and adapt the code to best fit your specific use case. Customization allows you to tailor the solution to the unique characteristics of your face age prediction dataset.

## Model Performance

After training, you can evaluate the model's performance on the test set and calculate its accuracy.

```python
test_loss, test_mae, test_mse = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)

threshold = 5
correct_predictions = sum(1 for i in range(len(predictions)) if abs(predictions[i] - y_test[i]) <= threshold)
accuracy = correct_predictions / len(predictions) * 100

print(f'Test Loss: {test_loss}')
print(f'Mean Absolute Error (MAE): {test_mae}')
print(f'Mean Squared Error (RMSE): {test_mse}')
print(f'Accuracy (within {threshold} years): {accuracy:.2f}%')
